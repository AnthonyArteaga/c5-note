# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Configuration:

* Place the provided vite.config.js file in /C5-Note.

* To enable running on Aptitude, change "cse-442al" to your UBIT.


Dependencys to Run:
NodeJS

To run this application use the following commands:

cd C5-Note
npm install
npm run dev 

This will start and make the pre generated vite application viewable in the browser.
